# TextToSpeechSerialConnectionTest
 Using a raspberry pi, arduino, and emic 2 text-to-speech module, send strings over serial connection


## Setup

- Connect the arduino to the emic 2, making sure the correct serial pins are attached (see code).
- be sure this has 5V, not 3.3V
- connect the arduino to the raspberry pi using a micro-usb hub or GPIO serial connection
- create a virtual environment on the  raspberry pi and install the serial package
- launch the main script and enter text when prompted
- be sure the emic 2 is plugged into headphones or speakers, and listen for the result
